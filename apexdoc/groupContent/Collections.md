The class library includes the following collection-related enhancements:
* An Apex implementation of [`MultiMap`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimap).
* [`CollectionUtil`](CollectionUtil),  a set of common utility methods for many of these frequently required collection operations.
* A set of standard comparators via the [`Comparators`](Comparators) factory class for ordering lists of primitive types and lists of SObjects by a particular field value. These standard comparators can be configured for the direction of sorting (ascending vs. descending), how null values are handled (nulls first vs. nulls last), and as appropriate, case-sensitivity of string comparisons. The standard comparators can also be used as building blocks for more complex comparators via composition and delegation.
